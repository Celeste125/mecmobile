Mecanum mobile &amp; SLAM

The project focuses on the development of a Mecanum wheel robot capable of moving autonomously from point A to point B. The initial position can be selected, and from there the robot uses advanced localization algorithms to determine and update its position in the environment.

Specifically, the system integrates:

Monte Carlo Localization (MCL): particle filter-based estimation of the robotâ€™s position.

Global Localization: enabling the robot to localize itself without prior knowledge of its starting point.

Local Localization: ensuring real-time correction and improved accuracy during navigation.

With these functionalities, the robot can not only reach defined target positions but also adapt to different navigation scenarios with high precision.
