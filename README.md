# ðŸ¤– Mecmobile
**Mecanum Mobile & SLAM**

The project focuses on the development of a **Mecanum wheel robot** capable of moving autonomously from point A to point B.  
The initial position can be selected, and from there the robot uses advanced localization algorithms to determine and update its position in the environment.

Specifically, the system integrates:
- **Monte Carlo Localization (MCL):** particle filter-based estimation of the robotâ€™s position.  
- **Global Localization:** enabling the robot to localize itself without prior knowledge of its starting point.  
- **Local Localization:** ensuring real-time correction and improved accuracy during navigation.  

With these functionalities, the robot can not only reach defined target positions but also adapt to different navigation scenarios with high precision.
